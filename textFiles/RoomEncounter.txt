Room 1
  1. description of Room
  2. roll initiative based on speed
  3. combat:
      enemy
  4. explore:
      possibly generated loot
      random articles in room
  4. movement
      exit home (secure loot)
      continue to next room (risk it for biscuit)

Note: 3 and 4 are interchangable based on initiative roll
  if your initiative roll is higher than the enemy, you have
  the option to either enter combat or explore.

  Players initiative for attacking first is lost if player decides
  to explore instead of enter combat first.
